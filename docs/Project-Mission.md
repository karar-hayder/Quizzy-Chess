## Quizzy Chess: Think Before You Take

---

## üéØ Project Mission

Quizzy Chess is a full-stack, real-time multiplayer chess platform that integrates educational quizzes into gameplay. When a player attempts to capture a high-value piece (queen, rook, bishop), they must correctly answer a subject-based question to complete the move. The project aims to foster cognitive engagement, subject learning, and strategic thinking through gamified education.

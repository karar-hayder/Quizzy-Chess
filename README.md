# Quizzy Chess

## üöÄ About the Project

Quizzy Chess is a fullstack, real-time multiplayer chess platform with educational quizzes integrated into gameplay. Initially developed at the DevSprint Hackathon (Baghdad, Iraq, June 2025) where I served as the backend developer, I later rebuilt the entire frontend from scratch, making this a complete fullstack project under my ownership. This project represents my most comprehensive fullstack build to date, applying and strengthening my skills in Redis, Docker, WebSockets, fullstack development, Celery tasks, AI, MVP building, testing, and more.

When a player attempts to capture a high-value piece (queen, rook, bishop), they must correctly answer a subject-based quiz to complete the move. This unique mechanic blends cognitive engagement, subject learning, and strategic thinking through gamified education.

## üèÜ Hackathon & Personal Journey

- **Event:** DevSprint Hackathon, Baghdad, Iraq, June 2025
- **Role:** Backend developer (hackathon); fullstack developer (this project)
- **Highlights:**
  - During the hackathon, I was responsible for the backend architecture, real-time logic, and core game/quiz logic.
  - After the event, I rebuilt the frontend from scratch, integrating it tightly with the backend and adding modern UI/UX, new features, and improved architecture.
  - Applied and strengthened my skills in:
    - Redis (caching, pub/sub, broker)
    - Docker (multi-service orchestration)
    - Django Channels & WebSockets (real-time)
    - Celery (background tasks)
    - AI/LLM integration (quiz generation)
    - MVP design, testing, and rapid iteration
    - Fullstack architecture (Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis)
    - Production-ready DevOps (Docker Compose, Nginx, Vercel/Render)
  - Built a robust, demo-ready MVP with modern UI/UX and real-time features
